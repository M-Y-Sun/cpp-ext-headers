# Extended C++ Headers

Header files for non-native C++ algorithms and data structures, as well as miscellaneous functions.

Headers can be found in `/src/include/` and implementation files can be found in `/src/implm/`.

### Example Run

Run

```
$ make
```

to compile a demo program showing the basic functionality of each algorithm and data structure.
The compiled binary exists in the `bin/` directory and can be ran by running

```
$ ./bin/main.elf
```
